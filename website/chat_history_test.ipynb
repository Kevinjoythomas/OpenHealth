The symptoms he is showing like not being able to sit still, hyperactive, impulsive behavior etc., are classic features of ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder). It is possible that your son might be having this condition which can affect his academic performance and social behavior. I would advise you the following things- Consult a psychologist for detailed evaluation and assessment of your child's symptoms. There is no cure but proper treatment like medicines, behavioral therapy and counseling by a qualified mental health professional can help in improving the symptoms. Hope I have answered your question. Feel free to ask further if needed. Thank you.\n"
